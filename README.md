# Google's Foobar Challenges
In this repository are all my implementation of the different challenges I got on Google's Foobar challanges.
Soon I will upload even more challanges...

## Some Details
Some of the challenges have different difficulties and different objectives. For instance, the Braille inscription challenge is easy compared to others such as the State Transitioning Ore challenge.
Another thing is that my implemetations are in Java as way to practice with it.
